# Utilities
This folder contains several (unrelated) utilities.

**[Python] GPXheatmap**
This *tool* can be used to create heat maps from GPX data: Garmin Activity Data. Simply export the activity data from the Garmin app, store all GPX files in the same folder, and run this file from within that same folder. The script will create simple heat maps.

**[Python] batch-recur**

This *template* is for batch conversion/analysis of files. If a certain (commandline) script must be executed for a lot of files, this script can do that in an automated way. The script must be changed in order to work!
